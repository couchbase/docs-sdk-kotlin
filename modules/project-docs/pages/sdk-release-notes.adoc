[[v1.0.1]]
== Version 1.0.1 (8 June 2022)

=== Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/KCBC-79[KCBC-79]:
JacksonJsonSerializer now accepts the jackson `ObjectMapper` which for example makes it easier to use out of the box with Spring Boot.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-1093[JVMCBC-1093]:
Previously, when a DNS SRV lookup failure occured, the SDK logged this as a `WARNING` along with a stack trace.
The lookup failure is typically harmless, so the log message has now been downgraded to `INFO` level, without a stack trace.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-1088[JVMCBC-1088]:
Updated Netty to version `4.1.77.Final`.
